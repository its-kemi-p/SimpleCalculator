# Simple Calculator

A console-based Java calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input.

## Features
- Prompts users to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /).
- Validates user input to ensure numbers are valid and operators are supported.
- Handles errors such as division by zero and invalid operators.
- Displays results formatted to two decimal places.
- Code includes detailed comments for clarity.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed.
- A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA) or command-line tools for compiling and running Java code.
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository).

## How to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/SimpleCalculator.git
## Navigate to the Project Folder:
